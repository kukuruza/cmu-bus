FIXME:
"no more buses" didn't work yesterday. Today it works
every time request is somehow executed twice
times after midnight will not be shown at e.g. 11.45 pm

TODO:
need to add help activity
need to add configs on what to use: remote/local
need a label to show the info source: remote/local
need to refactor BaseEntities vs Entities classes
move common package somewhere so that app and webserver can share it
webserver: put relative path to db resource

FEATURES:
move filter on time logic to requests in order to shorten times
